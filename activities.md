# Patriotism

Susquehanna County Chapter NSDAR supports veterans in our community by recognizing service to our country.  We participate in the annual Wreaths Across American, primarily in the Harford Cemetery.  Revolutionary War veterans’ gravesites have flag holders and there are plaques in the County Courthouse in remembrance of our Revolutionary War veterans.  Some of the other activities we participate in include collecting items for the Veteran’s Home residents, sending care packages to troops overseas, making baby blankets for babies of active military and supporting the veteran’s Honor Flights.

# Historic Preservation

Susquehanna County Chapter NSDAR supports prospective members with their genealogy searches.  We are hoping to expand our support of gravestone cleaning projects.
