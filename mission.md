# Patriotism

Susquehanna County Chapter, NSDAR, supports veterans in our community by recognizing service to our country.  We participate in the annual Wreaths Across America, primarily in the Harford Cemetery.  American Revolutionary War veterans’ gravesites have flag holders and there are plaques in the county courthouse in their honor.  Some of the other activities we participate in include collecting items for the veterans home residents, sending care packages to troops overseas, making baby blankets for babies of active military, and supporting the veteran’s Honor Flights.

# Historic Preservation

Susquehanna County Chapter, NSDAR, supports prospective members with their genealogy searches.  We are hoping to expand our support of gravestone cleaning projects.
