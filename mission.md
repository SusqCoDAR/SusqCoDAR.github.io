# Education

**Scholarships**: Susquehanna County DAR awards a $1,000 scholarship each year to a Susquehanna County High School senior.  Students should check with their school guidance counselors to apply for 2023!

**Good Citizens Award** is given to one senior from each of the high schools in Susquehanna County.

Prepare now!  The application process begins in the FALL of each school year.  Check with your Guidance Counselor for information and deadlines.

For more information, contact the [Susquehanna County Chapter](/contact.html).

# Patriotism

Susquehanna County Chapter, NSDAR, supports veterans in our community by recognizing service to our country.  We participate in the annual Wreaths Across American, primarily in the Harford Cemetery.  Revolutionary War veterans’ gravesites have flag holders and there are plaques in the County Courthouse in remembrance of our Revolutionary War veterans.  Some of the other activities we participate in include collecting items for the Veteran’s Home residents, sending care packages to troops overseas, making baby blankets for babies of active military, and supporting the veteran’s Honor Flights.

# Historic Preservation

Susquehanna County Chapter NSDAR supports prospective members with their genealogy searches.  We are hoping to expand our support of gravestone cleaning projects.
